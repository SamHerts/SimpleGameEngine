# Game Engine Project

A modern C++17 game engine featuring a component-based architecture with physics simulation capabilities.

## Features

- Component-based entity system architecture
- 3D Vector mathematics (Vec3)
- Physics system with gravity and movement simulation
- SDL3 integration for rendering and window management

## Requirements

- C++17 compatible compiler
- SDL3 library
- CMake build system

## Project Structure

The engine is built with the following core components:

- **Vector Mathematics**: Custom `Vec3` class for 3D vector operations
- **Physics System**: Handles entity movement and gravity simulation
- **Component System**: Features a coordinator pattern for managing entity components

## Building the Project

1. Make sure you have CMake and a C++17 compatible compiler installed
2. Clone the repository
3. Configure the project:
